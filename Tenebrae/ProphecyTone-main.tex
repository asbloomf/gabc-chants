\emph{The flex is made towards the middle of each sentence; it is omitted only if the sentence is very short.  In the longer sentences, the flex may be repeated several times if the sense allows this being done.  The metrum does not occur in this tone.

% from page 121* in Graduale Romanum
At colons that introduce speech, whether quoted or indirect, a flex is not made, but instead the last syllable is lengthened, and a slight pause added:}
