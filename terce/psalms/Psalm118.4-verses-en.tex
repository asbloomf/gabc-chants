\item Be thou mindful of thy word to thy servant, * in which thou hast given me hope.
\item This hath comforted me in my humiliation: * because thy word hath enlivened me.
\item The proud did iniquitously altogether: * but I declined not from thy law.
\item I remembered, O Lord, thy judgments of old: * and I was comforted.
\item A fainting hath taken hold of me, * because of the wicked that forsake thy law.
\item Thy justifications were the subject of my song, * in the place of my pilgrimage.
\item In the night I have remembered thy name, O Lord: * and have kept thy law.
\item This happened to me: * because I sought after thy justifications.
\item O Lord, my portion, * I have said, I would keep thy law.
\item I entreated thy face with all my heart: * have mercy on me according to thy word.
\item I have thought on my ways: * and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.
\item I am ready, and am not troubled: * that I may keep thy commandments.
\item The cords of the wicked have encompassed me: * but I have not forgotten thy law.
\item I rose at midnight to give praise to thee; * for the judgments of thy justification.
\item I am a partaker with all them that fear thee, * and that keep thy commandments.
\item The earth, O Lord, is full of thy mercy: * teach me thy justifications.
