\item Set before me for a law the way of thy justifications, O Lord: * and I will always seek after it.
\item Give me understanding, and I will search thy law; * and I will keep it with my whole heart.
\item Lead me into the path of thy commandments; * for this same I have desired.
\item Incline my heart into thy testimonies * and not to covetousness.
\item Turn away my eyes that they may not behold vanity: * quicken me in thy way.
\item Establish thy word to thy servant, * in thy fear.
\item Turn away my reproach, which I have apprehended: * for thy judgments are delightful.
\item Behold I have longed after thy precepts: * quicken me in thy justice.
\item Let thy mercy also come upon me, O Lord: * thy salvation according to thy word.
\item So shall I answer them that reproach me in any thing; * that I have trusted in thy words.
\item And take not thou the word of truth utterly out of my mouth: * for in thy words, I have hoped exceedingly.
\item So shall I always keep thy law, * for ever and ever.
\item And I walked at large: * because I have sought after thy commandments.
\item And I spoke of thy testimonies before kings: * and I was not ashamed.
\item I meditated also on thy commandments, * which I loved.
\item And I lifted up my hands to thy commandments, which I loved: * and I was exercised in thy justifications.
