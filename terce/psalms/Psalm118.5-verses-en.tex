\item Thou hast done well with thy servant, O Lord, * according to thy word.
\item Teach me goodness and discipline and knowledge; * for I have believed thy commandments.
\item Before I was humbled I offended; * therefore have I kept thy word.
\item Thou art good; * and in thy goodness teach me thy justifications.
\item The iniquity of the proud hath been multiplied over me: * but I will seek thy commandments with my whole heart.
\item Their heart is curdled like milk: * but I have meditated on thy law.
\item It is good for me that thou hast humbled me, * that I may learn thy justifications.
\item The law of thy mouth is good to me, * above thousands of gold and silver.
\item Thy hands have made me and formed me: * give me understanding, and I will learn thy commandments.
\item They that fear thee shall see me, and shall be glad: * because I have greatly hoped in thy words.
\item I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are equity: * and in thy truth thou hast humbled me.
\item O! let thy mercy be for my comfort, * according to thy word unto thy servant.
\item Let thy tender mercies come unto me, and I shall live: * for thy law is my meditation.
\item Let the proud be ashamed, because they have done unjustly towards me: * but I will be employed in thy commandments.
\item Let them that fear thee turn to me: * and they that know thy testimonies.
\item Let my heart be undefiled in thy justifications, * that I may not be confounded.
