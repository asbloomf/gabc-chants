\item Look on this wounded heart, and know
for our offence 'twas cloven so;
for guilty man's perfidious deeds the pure and heavenly Victim bleeds.

\item What worse than heathen souls are here
whose sins direct the heathen spear
and wound that blessed Heart from whence
proceed our succour and defence.

\item Wherefrom, as Eve from Adam's side,
is born the new mysterious Bride;
wherethrough, like Noë's faithful band,
forth from the ark we pass to land.

\item Thence like a sevenfold river flows
grace that no bound or measure knows;
thither the sinful tribes repair
and wash their robes to whiteness there.

\item Oh may our hearts the semblance take
of His who suffered for our sake
and in our bosoms burn the same
divine and ever-during flame.

\item Christ, from whose Heart all grace is poured,
be everlastingly adored,
and equal praises still repeat
the Father and the Paraclete.
Amen.%\grechangestaffsize{15}
