\item All ye who seek full longingly
For Christ, lift up your eyes on high:
There may ye see the vision bright,
Th'eternal Son, in glorious light.

\item Behold, His splendour now appears,
Who knows no change from passing years,
Exalted, infinite, sublime,
Before the void or heaven's prime.

\item This is the King of nations all,
The King of Jewry's race withal,
Promis'd to Abraham of yore,
And to his seed for evermore.

\item To Him the prophets testify,
And set their seal of witness high;
The Father from His heav'nly throne,
Now bids us hear His only Son.

\item O Jesu, who Thyself dost show
To lowly ones, all glory now
To Thee, with God the Father be,
And Holy Ghost eternally.  Amen. %\grechangestaffsize{15}
