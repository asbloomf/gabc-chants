{Thou hast protected me, O God, from the counsel of the wicked, from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity. Now let us contemplate our Head himself. Many martyrs have suffered like things, but naught shineth out in such wise as the Head of the Martyrs; in Him we best perceive what they endured. He was protected from the counsel of the wicked; God protected himself; the Very Son, with the manhood which he took upon him, protected his own flesh; because He is the Son of man, and the Son of God; Son of God, being in the form of God; Son of man, being in the form of a servant, having power to lay down his life, and to take it up again. What then could his enemies do against him? They killed the Body, the Soul they killed not. Give heed: It had been a small thing for the Lord to encourage Martyrs by His word, if He had not also strengthened them by His example.}

{Ye know what the counsel was of the wicked Jews, and what that insurrection was of the workers of iniquity. What was their iniquity? That they wanted to kill the Lord Jesus Christ. Many good works, saith He, have I showed you; for which of them do you want to kill Me? He had borne with all their weaknesses: He had healed all their diseases: He had preached unto them the kingdom of heaven: He held not his peace at their iniquities, that they might hate them rather than the Physician That came to cure them. And now at last, without gratitude for all the tenderness of His healing love, like men raging in an high delirium, throwing themselves madly on the Physician, Who had come to cure them, they took counsel together how they might kill Him, as if to see if He were a Man and could die, or Something more than a man that would not let Himself die. In the Wisdom of Solomon we recognize their words: Let us condemn Him with a shameful death. Let us examine Him; for, by His own saying, He shall be respected. If He be the Son of God, let Him help Him.}

{They whetted their tongue like a sword. Let not the Jews say: We did not kill Christ. For they gave Him over to Pilate the judge, that they themselves might seem free of His death. For when Pilate said unto them, Take ye Him: and kill Him, they answered, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death. They desired to cast the injustice of their wicked deed upon a human judge: but did they deceive God the Judge? In that which Pilate did, he was their accomplice, but in comparison with them, he was much more innocent. Pilate strove as far as he could, to deliver Him out of their hands and therefore ordered Him to be scourged and brought before them. He scourged not the Lord in persecution, but to satisfy their rage: that, perchance, even they might be touched with compassion, and cease to lust for His death, when they saw What He was after the flagellation. Even this effort he made! But when they persisted, ye know how he washed his hands and said that he did it not himself, the he was innocent of His death. Nevertheless he did do it. But if he were guilty who did it against his will, were they innocent who goaded him on to it? No. Pilate gave sentence against Him and commanded Him to be crucified, and thus in a manner slew him. But ye, O ye Jews, ye have killed Him! How did ye kill him? With the sword of the tongue, for ye had whet your tongues. And when smote ye? But when ye cried, Crucify Him! Crucify Him!}
