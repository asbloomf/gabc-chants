\prayer{Festinémus íngredi in illam réquiem~: ut ne in idípsum quis íncidat incredulitátis exémplum.
Vivus est enim sermo Dei, et éfficax, et penetrabílior omni gládio ancípiti~: et pertíngens usque ad divisiónem ánimæ ac spíritus, compágum quoque ac medullárum, et discrétor cogitatiónum et intentiónum cordis.
Et non est ulla creatúra invisíbilis in conspéctu ejus~: ómnia autem nuda et apérta sunt óculis ejus, ad quem nobis sermo.
Habéntes ergo Pontíficem magnum, qui penetrávit cælos, Jesum Fílium Dei~: teneámus confessiónem.
Non enim habémus Pontíficem qui non possit cómpati infirmitátibus nostris~: tentátum autem per ómnia pro similitúdine absque peccáto.}
{Let us hasten therefore to enter into that rest; lest any man fall into the same example of unbelief.
For the word of God is living and effectual, and more piercing than any two edged sword; and reaching unto the division of the soul and the spirit, of the joints also and the marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
Neither is there any creature invisible in his sight: but all things are naked and open to his eyes, to whom our speech is.
Having therefore a great high priest that hath passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God: let us hold fast our confession.
For we have not a high priest, who cannot have compassion on our infirmities: but one tempted in all things like as we are, yet without sin.}

{Let us go therefore with confidence to the throne of grace: that we may obtain mercy, and find grace in seasonable aid.
For every high priest taken from among men, is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer up gifts and sacrifices for sins:
Who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err: because he himself also is compassed with infirmity.
And therefore he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.}

{Neither doth any man take the honour to himself, but he that is called by God, as Aaron was.
So also Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest: but he that said unto him: Thou art my Son, today have I begotten thee.
As he saith also in another place: Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech.
Who in the days of his flesh, with a strong cry and tears, offering up prayers and supplications to him that was able to save him from death, was heard for his reverence.
And whereas indeed he was the Son of God, he learned obedience by the things which he suffered:
And being consummated, he became, to all that obey him, the cause of eternal salvation.
Called by God a high priest according to the order of Melchisedech.}
