\item Why, impious Herod, vainly fear
That Christ the Saviour cometh here?
He takes no earthly realms away
Who gives the crown that lasts for aye.

\item To greet His birth the Wise Men went,
Led by the star before them sent;
Called on by light, towards light they pressed,
And by their gifts their God confessed.

\item In holy Jordan's purest wave
The heavenly Lamb vouchsafed to lave;
That He, to Whom was sin unknown,
Might cleanse His people from their own.

\item New miracle of power divine!
The water reddens into wine:
He spake the word: and poured the wave
In other streams than nature gave.

\item All glory, Lord, to Thee we pay
For Thine Epiphany to-day:
All glory, as is ever meet,
To Father and to Paraclete.
Amen.
