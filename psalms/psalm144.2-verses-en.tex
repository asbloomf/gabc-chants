\item The Lord is gracious and merciful: patient and plenteous in mercy.
\item The Lord is sweet to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.
\item Let all thy works, O Lord, praise thee: and let thy saints bless thee.
\item They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom: and shall tell of thy power:
\item To make thy might known to the sons of men: and the glory of the magnificence of thy kingdom.
\item Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all ages: and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.
