\item Sing ye to the Lord a new canticle: because he hath done wonderful things.
\item His right hand hath wrought for him salvation, and his arm is holy.
\item The Lord hath made known his salvation: he hath revealed his justice in the sight of the Gentiles.
\item He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel.
\item All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
\item Sing joyfully to God, all the earth; make melody, rejoice and sing.
\item Sing praise to the Lord on the harp, on the harp, and with the voice of a psalm: with long trumpets, and sound of cornet.
\item Make a joyful noise before the Lord our king: let the sea be moved and the fulness thereof: the world and they that dwell therein.
\item The rivers shall clap their hands, the mountains shall rejoice together at the presence of the Lord: because he cometh to judge the earth.
\item He shall judge the world with justice, and the people with equity.
