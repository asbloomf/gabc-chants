\item Blessed be the Lord my God, who teacheth my hands to fight, and my fingers to war.
\item My mercy, and my refuge: my support, and my deliverer:
\item My protector, and I have hoped in him: who subdueth my people under me.
\item Lord, what is man, that thou art made known to him? or the son of man, that thou makest account of him?
\item Man is like to vanity: his days pass away like a shadow.
\item Lord, bow down thy heavens and descend: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
\item Send forth lightning, and thou shalt scatter them: shoot out thy arrows, and thou shalt trouble them.
\item Put forth thy hand from on high, take me out, and deliver me from many waters: from the hand of strange children:
\item Whose mouth hath spoken vanity: and their right hand is the right hand of iniquity.
