\item I will extol thee, O God my king: and I will bless thy name for ever; yea, for ever and ever.
\item Every day will I bless thee: and I will praise thy name for ever; yea, for ever and ever.
\item Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised: and of his greatness there is no end.
\item Generation and generation shall praise thy works: and they shall declare thy power.
\item They shall speak of the magnificence of the glory of thy holiness: and shall tell thy wondrous works.
\item And they shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and shall declare thy greatness.
\item They shall publish the memory of the abundance of thy sweetness: and shall rejoice in thy justice.
