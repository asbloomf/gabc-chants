\item Blessed are all they that fear the Lord: that walk in his ways.
\item For thou shalt eat the labours of thy hands: blessed art thou, and it shall be well with thee.
\item Thy wife as a fruitful vine, on the sides of thy house.
\item Thy children as olive plants, round about thy table.
\item Behold, thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord.
\item May the Lord bless thee out of Sion: and mayst thou see the good things of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
\item And mayst thou see thy children’s children, peace upon Israel.
