\item Out of the depths I have cried to thee, O Lord: Lord, hear my voice.
\item Let thy ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication.
\item If thou, O Lord, wilt mark iniquities: Lord, who shall stand it.
\item For with thee there is merciful forgiveness: and by reason of thy law, I have waited for thee, O Lord.
\item My soul hath relied on his word: my soul hath hoped in the Lord.
\item From the morning watch even until night, let Israël hope in the Lord.
\item Because with the Lord there is mercy: and with him plentiful redemption.
\item And he shall redeem Israël from all his iniquities.
