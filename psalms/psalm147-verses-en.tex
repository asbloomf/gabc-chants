\item Praise the Lord, O Je\-ru\-sa\-lem: praise thy God, O Sion. 
\item Because he hath strengthened the bolts of thy gates he hath blessed thy children within thee. 
\item Who hath placed peace in thy borders: and filleth thee with the fat of corn.
\item Who sendeth forth his speech to the earth: his word runneth swiftly.
\item Who giveth snow like wool: scattereth mists like ashes.
\item He sendeth his crystal like morsels: who shall stand before the face of his cold?
\item He shall send out his word, and shall melt them: his wind shall blow, and the waters shall run.
\item Who declareth his word to Jacob: his justices and his judgments to Israël.
\item He hath not done so to every nation: and his judgments he hath not made manifest to them.
