\item Lord, thou hast blessed thy land: thou hast turned away the captivity of Jacob.
\item Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people: thou hast covered all their sins.
\item Thou hast mitigated all thy anger: thou hast turned away from the wrath of thy indignation.
\item Convert us, O God our saviour: and turn off thy anger from us.
\item Wilt thou be angry with us for ever: or wilt thou extend thy wrath from generation to generation?
\item Thou wilt turn, O God, and bring us to life: and thy people shall rejoice in thee.
\item Shew us, O Lord, thy mercy; and grant us thy salvation.
\item I will hear what the Lord God will speak in me: for he will speak peace
\item And unto his saints: and unto them that are converted to the heart.
\item Surely his salvation is near to them that fear him: that glory may dwell in our land.
\item Mercy and truth have met each other: justice and peace have kissed.
\item Truth is sprung out of the earth: and justice hath looked down from heaven.
\item For the Lord will give goodness: and our earth shall yield her fruit.
\item Justice shall walk before him: and shall set his steps in the way.
