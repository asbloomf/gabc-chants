\item Great is the Lord, and exceedingly to be praised in the city of our God, in his holy mountain.
\item With the joy of the whole earth is mount Sion founded, on the sides of the north, the city of the great king.
\item In her houses shall God be known, when he shall protect her.
\item For behold the kings of the earth assembled themselves: they gathered together.
\item So they saw, and they wondered, they were troubled, they were moved: trembling took hold of them.
\item There were pains as of a woman in labour; with a vehement wind thou shalt break in pieces the ships of Tharsis.
\item As we have heard, so have we seen, in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: God hath founded it for ever.
\item We have received thy mercy, O God, in the midst of thy temple.
\item According to thy name, O God, so also is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of justice.
\item Let mount Sion rejoice, and the daughters of Juda be glad; because of thy judgments, O Lord.
\item Surround Sion, and encompass her: tell ye in her towers.
\item Set your hearts on her strength; and distribute her houses, that ye may relate it in another generation.
\item For this is God, our God unto eternity, and for ever and ever: he shall rule us for evermore.
