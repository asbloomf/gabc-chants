\item I Rejoiced at the things that were said to me: We shall go into the house of the Lord.
\item Our feet were standing in thy courts, O Jerusalem.
\item Jerusalem, which is built as a city, which is compact together.
\item For thither did the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord: the testimony of Israël, to praise the name of the Lord.
\item Because their seats have sat in judgment, seats upon the house of David.
\item Pray ye for the things that are for the peace of Jerusalem: and abundance for them that love thee.
\item Let peace be in thy strength: and abundance in thy towers.
\item For the sake of my brethren, and of my neighbours, I spoke peace of thee.
\item Because of the house of the Lord our God, I have sought good things for thee.
