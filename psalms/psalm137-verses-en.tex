\item I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: for thou hast heard the words of my mouth.
\item I will sing praise to thee in the sight of the Angels: I will worship towards thy holy temple, and I will give glory to thy name.
\item For thy mercy, and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy holy name above all.
\item In what day soever I shall call upon thee, hear me: thou shalt multiply strength in my soul.
\item May all the kings of the earth give thee glory, O Lord: for they have heard all the words of thy mouth.
\item And let them sing in the ways of the Lord: for great is the glory of the Lord.
\item For the Lord is high, and looketh on the low: and the high he knoweth afar off.
\item If I shall walk in the midst of tribulation, thou wilt quicken me: thou hast stretched forth thy hand against the wrath of my enemies: and thy right hand hath saved me.
\item The Lord will repay for me: thy mercy, O Lord, endureth for ever: O despise not the works of thy hands.
