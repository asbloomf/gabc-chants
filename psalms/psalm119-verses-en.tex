\item In my trouble I cried to the Lord: and he heard me.
\item O Lord, deliver my soul from wicked lips, and a deceitful tongue.
\item What shall be given to thee, or what shall be added to thee, to a deceitful tongue?
\item The sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals that lay waste.
\item Woe is me, that my sojourning is prolonged! I have dwelt with the inhabitants of Cedar: my soul hath been long a sojourner.
\item With them that hated peace I was peaceable: when I spoke to them they fought against me without cause.
