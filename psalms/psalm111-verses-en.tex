\item Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord: he shall delight exceedingly in his commandments.
\item His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the righteous shall be blessed.
\item Glory and wealth shall be in his house: and his justice remaineth for ever and ever.
\item To the righteous a light is risen up in darkness: he is merciful, and compassionate and just.
\item Acceptable is the man that showeth mercy and lendeth: he shall order his words with judgment: because he shall not be moved for ever.
\item The just shall be in everlasting remembrance: he shall not hear the evil hearing.
\item His heart is ready to hope in the Lord: his heart is strengthened, he shall not be moved until he look over his enemies.
\item He hath distributed, he hath given to the poor: his justice remaineth for ever and ever: his horn shall be exalted in glory.
\item The wicked shall see, and shall be angry, he shall gnash with his teeth and pine away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.
