\item The Lord said to my Lord: Sit thou at my right hand: 
\item Until I make thy enemies thy footstool.
\item The Lord will send forth the sceptre of thy power out of Sion: rule thou in the midst of thy enemies.
\item With thee is the principality in the day of thy strength: in the brightness of the saints: from the womb before the day star I begot thee.
\item The Lord hath sworn, and he will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech.
\item The Lord at thy right hand hath broken kings in the day of his wrath.
\item He shall judge among nations, he shall fill ruins: he shall crush the heads in the land of the many.
\item He shall drink of the torrent in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.
