\item I have believed, therefore have I spoken; but I have been humbled exceedingly.
\item I said in my excess: Every man is a liar.
\item What shall I render to the Lord, for all the things that he hath rendered to me?
\item I will take the chalice of salvation; and I will call upon the name of the Lord.
\item I will pay my vows to the Lord before all his people: precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.
\item O Lord, for I am thy servant: I am thy servant, and the son of thy handmaid.
\item Thou hast broken my bonds: I will sacrifice to thee the sacrifice of praise, and I will call upon the name of the Lord.
\item I will pay my vows to the Lord in the sight of all his people: in the courts of the house of the Lord, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem.
