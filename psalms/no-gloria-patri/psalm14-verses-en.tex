\item Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? or who shall rest on thy holy hill?
\item He that walketh without blemish, and worketh justice:
\item He that speaketh truth in his heart, who hath not used deceit in his tongue:
\item Nor hath done evil to his neighbour: nor taken up a reproach against his neighbours.
\item In his sight the malignant is brought to nothing: but he glorifieth them that fear the Lord:
\item He that sweareth to his neighbour, and deceiveth not; He that hath not put out his money to usury, nor taken bribes against the innocent:
\item He that doth these things, shall not be moved for ever.
