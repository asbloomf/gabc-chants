\item Hear, O God, my prayer, when I make supplication to thee: deliver my soul from the fear of the enemy.
\item Thou hast protected me from the assembly of the malignant; from the multitude of the workers of iniquity.
\item For they have whetted their tongues like a sword; they have bent their bow a bitter thing, to shoot in secret the undefiled.
\item They will shoot at him on a sudden, and will not fear: they are resolute in wickedness.
\item They have talked of hiding snares; they have said: Who shall see them?
\item They have searched after iniquities: they have failed in their search.
\item Man shall come to a deep heart: and God shall be exalted.
\item The arrows of children are their wounds: and their tongues against them are made weak.
\item All that saw them were troubled; and every man was afraid.
\item And they declared the works of God: and understood his doings.
\item The just shall rejoice in the Lord, and shall hope in him: and all the upright in heart shall be praised.
