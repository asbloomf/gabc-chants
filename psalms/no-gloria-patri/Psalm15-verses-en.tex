\item Preserve me, O Lord, for I have trusted in thee. I have said to the Lord, thou art my God, for thou hast no need of my goods.
\item To the saints, who are in his land, he hath made wonderful all my desires in them.
\item Their infirmities were multiplied: afterwards they made haste.
\item I will not gather together their meetings for blood offerings: nor will I be mindful of their names by my lips.
\item The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: it is thou that wilt restore my inheritance to me.
\item The lines are fallen unto me in goodly places: for my inheritance is goodly to me.
\item I will bless the Lord, who hath given me understanding: moreover my reins also have corrected me even till night.
\item I set the Lord always in my sight: for he is at my right hand, that I be not moved.
\item Therefore my heart hath been glad, and my tongue hath rejoiced: moreover my flesh also shall rest in hope.
\item Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; nor wilt thou give thy holy one to see corruption.
\item Thou hast made known to me the ways of life, thou shalt fill me with joy with thy countenance: at thy right hand are delights even to the end.
