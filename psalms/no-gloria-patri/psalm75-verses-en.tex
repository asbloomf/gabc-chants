\item In Judea God is known: his name is great in Israel.
\item And his place is in peace: and his abode in Sion:
\item There hath he broken the powers of bows, the shield, the sword, and the battle.
\item Thou enlightenest wonderfully from the everlasting hills. All the foolish of heart were troubled.
\item They have slept their sleep; and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands.
\item At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, they have all slumbered that mounted on horseback.
\item Thou art terrible, and who shall resist thee? from that time thy wrath.
\item Thou hast caused judgment to be heard from heaven: the earth trembled and was still,
\item When God arose in judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.
\item For the thought of man shall give praise to thee: and the remainders of the thought shall keep holiday to thee.
\item Vow ye, and pay to the Lord your God: all you that are round about him bring presents.
\item To him that is terrible, even to him who taketh away the spirit of princes: to the terrible with the kings of the earth.
