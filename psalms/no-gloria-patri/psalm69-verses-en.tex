\item O God, come to my assistance; O Lord, make haste to help me.
\item Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek my soul:
\item Let them be turned backward, and blush for shame that desire evils to me:
\item Let them be presently turned away blushing for shame that say to me: ’Tis well, ’tis well.
\item Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; and let such as love thy salvation say always: The Lord be magnified.
\item But I am needy and poor; O God, help me.
\item Thou art my helper and my deliverer: O Lord, make no delay.
