\item The earth is the Lordâ€™s and the fulness thereof: the world, and all they that dwell therein.
\item For he hath founded it upon the seas; and hath prepared it upon the rivers.
\item Who shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord: or who shall stand in his holy place?
\item The innocent in hands, and clean of heart, who hath not taken his soul in vain, nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbour.
\item He shall receive a blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God his Saviour.
\item This is the generation of them that seek him, of them that seek the face of the God of Jacob.
\item Lift up your gates, O ye princes, and be ye lifted up, O eternal gates: and the King of Glory shall enter in.
\item Who is this King of Glory? the Lord who is strong and mighty: the Lord mighty in battle.
\item Lift up your gates, O ye princes, and be ye lifted up, O eternal gates: and the King of Glory shall enter in.
\item Who is this King of Glory? the Lord of hosts, he is the King of Glory.
