\item Praise ye the Lord, because psalm is good: to our God be joyful and comely praise.
\item The Lord buildeth up Jerusalem: he will gather together the dispersed of Israel
\item Who healeth the broken of heart, and bindeth up their bruises.
\item Who telleth the number of the stars: and calleth them all by their names.
\item Great is our Lord, and great is his power: and of his wisdom there is no number.
\item The Lord lifteth up the meek, and bringeth the wicked down even to the ground.
\item Sing ye to the Lord with praise: sing to our God upon the harp.
\item Who covereth the heaven with clouds, and prepareth rain for the earth.
\item Who maketh grass to grow on the mountains, and herbs for the service of men.
\item Who giveth to beasts their food: and to the young ravens that call upon him.
\item He shall not delight in the strength of the horse: nor take pleasure in the legs of a man.
\item The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him: and in them that hope in his mercy.
