\item When I called upon him, the God of my justice heard me: when I was in distress, thou hast enlarged me.
\item Have mercy on me: and hear my prayer.
\item O ye sons of men, how long will you be dull of heart? Why do you love vanity, and seek after lying?
\item Know ye also that the Lord hath made his holy one wonderful: the Lord will hear me when I shall cry unto him.
\item Be ye angry, and sin not: the things you say in your hearts, be sorry for them upon your beds.
\item Offer up the sacrifice of justice, and trust in the Lord: many say, Who sheweth us good things?
\item The light of thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us: thou hast given gladness in my heart.
\item By the fruit of their corn, their wine, and oil, they are multiplied.
\item In peace in the selfsame I will sleep, and I will rest:
\item For thou, O Lord, singularly hast settled me in hope.
