\item It is good to give praise to the Lord: and to sing to thy name, O most High.
\item To shew forth thy mercy in the morning, and thy truth in the night:
\item Upon an instrument of ten strings, upon the psaltery: with a canticle upon the harp.
\item For thou hast given me, O Lord, a delight in thy doings: and in the works of thy hands I shall rejoice.
\item O Lord, how great are thy works! thy thoughts are exceeding deep.
\item The senseless man shall not know: nor will the fool understand these things.
\item When the wicked shall spring up as grass: and all the workers of iniquity shall appear:
\item That they may perish for ever and ever: but thou, O Lord, art most high for evermore.
\item For behold thy enemies, O Lord, for behold thy enemies shall perish: and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
\item But my horn shall be exalted like that of the unicorn: and my old age in plentiful mercy.
\item My eye also hath looked down upon my enemies: and my ear shall hear of the downfall of the malignant that rise up against me.
\item The just shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow up like the cedar of Libanus.
\item They that are planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of the house of our God.
\item They shall still increase in a fruitful old age: and shall be well treated, that they may shew,
\item That the Lord our God is righteous, and there is no iniquity in him.
