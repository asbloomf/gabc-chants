\item We will praise thee, O God: we will praise, and we will call upon thy name.
\item We will relate thy wondrous works: when I shall take a time, I will judge justices.
\item The earth is melted, and all that dwell therein: I have established the pillars thereof.
\item I said to the wicked: Do not act wickedly: and to the sinners: Lift not up the horn.
\item Lift not up your horn on high: speak not iniquity against God.
\item For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert hills: for God is the judge.
\item One he putteth down, and another he lifteth up: for in the hand of the Lord there is a cup of strong wine full of mixture.
\item And he hath poured it out from this to that: but the dregs thereof are not emptied: all the sinners of the earth shall drink.
\item But I will declare for ever: I will sing to the God of Jacob.
\item And I will break all the horns of sinners: but the horns of the just shall be exalted.
