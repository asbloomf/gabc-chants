\item Praise ye the Lord in his holy places: praise ye him in the firmament of his power.
\item Praise ye him for his mighty acts: praise ye him according to the multitude of his greatness.
\item Praise him with sound of trumpet: praise him with psaltery and harp.
\item Praise him with timbrel and choir: praise him with strings and organs.
\item Praise him on high sounding cymbals: praise him on cymbals of joy: let every spirit praise the Lord.
