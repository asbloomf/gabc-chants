\item Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me in thy strength.
\item O God, hear my prayer: give ear to the words of my mouth.
\item For strangers have risen up against me; and the mighty have sought after my soul: and they have not set God before their eyes.
\item For behold God is my helper: and the Lord is the protector of my soul.
\item Turn back the evils upon my enemies; and cut them off in thy truth.
\item I will freely sacrifice to thee, and will give praise, O God, to thy name: because it is good:
\item For thou hast delivered me out of all trouble: and my eye hath looked down upon my enemies.
