\item I have lifted up my eyes to the mountains, from whence help shall come to me.
\item My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
\item May he not suffer thy foot to be moved: neither let him slumber that keepeth thee.
\item Behold he shall neither slumber nor sleep, that keepeth Israel.
\item The Lord is thy keeper, the Lord is thy protection upon thy right hand.
\item The sun shall not burn thee by day: nor the moon by night.
\item The Lord keepeth thee from all evil: may the Lord keep thy soul.
\item May the Lord keep thy coming in and thy going out; from henceforth now and for ever.
