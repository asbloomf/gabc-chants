\item To thee, O God, I will sing a new canticle: on the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings I will sing praises to thee.
\item Who givest salvation to kings: who hast redeemed thy servant David from the malicious sword: Deliver me,
\item And rescue me out of the hand of strange children; whose mouth hath spoken vanity: and their right hand is the right hand of iniquity:
\item Whose sons are as new plants in their youth:
\item Their daughters decked out, adorned round about after the similitude of a temple:
\item Their storehouses full, flowing out of this into that.
\item Their sheep fruitful in young, abounding in their goings forth: their oxen fat.
\item There is no breach of wall, nor passage, nor crying out in their streets.
\item They have called the people happy, that hath these things: but happy is that people whose God is the Lord.
