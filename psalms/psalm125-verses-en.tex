\item When the Lord brought back the captivity of Sion, we became like men comforted.
\item Then was our mouth filled with gladness; and our tongue with joy.
\item Then shall they say among the Gentiles: The Lord hath done great things for them.
\item The Lord hath done great things for us: we are become joyful.
\item Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as a stream in the south.
\item They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
\item Going they went and wept, casting their seeds.
\item But coming they shall come with joyfulness, carrying their sheaves.
