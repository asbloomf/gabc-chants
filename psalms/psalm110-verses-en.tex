\item I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; in the council of the just: and in the congregation.
\item Great are the works of the Lord: sought out according to all his wills
\item His work is praise and magnificence: and his justice continueth for ever and ever.
\item He hath made a remembrance of his wonderful works, being a merciful and gracious Lord: he hath given food to them that fear him.
\item He will be mindful for ever of his covenant: he will shew forth to his people the power of his works.
\item That he may give them the inheritance of the Gentiles: the works of his hands are truth and judgment.
\item All his commandments are faithful: confirmed for ever and ever, made in truth and equity.
\item He hath sent redemption to his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever.
\item Holy and terrible is his name: the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
\item A good understanding to all that do it: his praise continueth for ever and ever.
