\item Praise the Lord, ye children: praise ye the name of the Lord.
\item Blessed be the name of the Lord, from henceforth now and for ever.
\item From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same, the name of the Lord is worthy of praise.
\item The Lord is high above all nations; and his glory above the heavens.
\item Who is as the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high: and looketh down on the low things in heaven and in earth?
\item Raising up the needy from the earth, and lifting up the poor out of the dunghill:
\item That he may place him with princes, with the princes of his people.
\item Who maketh a barren woman to dwell in a house, the joyful mother of children.
