\item I have loved, because the Lord will hear the voice of my prayer.
\item Because he hath inclined his ear unto me: and in my days I will call upon him.
\item The sorrows of death have compassed me: and the perils of hell have found me.
\item I met with trouble and sorrow: and I called upon the name of the Lord.
\item O Lord, deliver my soul. The Lord is merciful and just, and our God sheweth mercy.
\item The Lord is the keeper of little ones: I was humbled, and he delivered me.
\item Turn, O my soul, into thy rest: for the Lord hath been bountiful to thee.
\item For he hath delivered my soul from death: my eyes from tears, my feet from falling.
\item I will please the Lord in the land of the living.
