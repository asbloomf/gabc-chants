\def\hymntranslation{\item Jesus, Redeemer of the world,
Begotten ere the dawn of light,
Wast of the Father's glory born,
Immense in glory as in might.

\item Thou art the Father's splendid light,
Thou art th'eternal hope of all
Throughout the world to Thee we pray,
O, hear Thy servants as they call.

\item Remember, O creator Lord!
That from the Virgin's sacred womb
Thou didst come forth, and of her flesh
Thou didst our mortal form assume.

\item This day, recurring, year by year,
Bears witness true that all alone
To save the world Thou camest forth,
Proceeding from the Father's throne.

\item This day, the stars, the earth, and sea,
And all creation welcome sing.
This day which brought our liberty.
When came our Lord, our Saviour, King.

\item And we, too, Lord, who have been washed
In Thine own font of Blood divine,
Offer the tribute of our praise
On this blest natal day of Thine.

\item O Jesu, of the Virgin born,
Unceasing glory be to Thee;
And to the Father infinite,
And Holy Ghost eternally.  Amen.
