\def\hymntranslation{\item Forth comes the Standard of the King:
All hail, thou Mystery ador'd!
Hail, Cross! on which the Life Himself
Died, and by death our life restor'd!
\item On which our Saviour's holy side
Rent open with a cruel spear
Of blood and water poured a stream,
To wash us from defilement clear.
\item O sacred wood! in Thee fulfill'd
Was holy David's truthful lay!
Which told the world, that from a tree
The Lord should all the nations sway.
\item Most royally empurpled o'er,
How beauteously thy stem doth shine!
How glorious was its lot to touch
Those limbs so holy and divine!
\item Thrice blest, upon whose arms outstretched
The Saviour of the world reclined;
Balance sublime! upon whose beam
Was weighed the ransom of mankind.
\item Hail, Cross! thou only hope of man,
Hail, on this holy Passionday!
To saints increase the grace they have;
From sinners purge their guilt away.
\item Salvation's spring, blest Trinity,
Be praise to Thee through earth and skies:
Thou through the Cross the victory
Dost give; oh, also give the prize!
Amen.}
