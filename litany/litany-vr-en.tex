\item Save Thy servants.
\item Who hope in Thee, my God.
\item Be unto us, O Lord, a tower of strength.
\item From the face of the enemy.
\item Let not the enemy prevail against us.
\item Nor the son of wickedness have power to hurt us.
\item O Lord, deal not with us according to our sins.
\item Neither requite us according to our iniquities.
\item Let us pray for our Sovereign Pontiff \emph{N}.
\item The Lord preserve him, and give him life, and make him blessed upon the earth, and deliver him not up to the will of his enemies.
\item Let us pray for our benefactors.
\item Vouchsafe, O Lord, for Thy Name's sake, to reward with eternal life all those who do us good. Amen.
\item Let us pray for the faithful departed.
\item Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon them.
\item May they rest in peace.
\item Amen.
\item For our absent brethren.\\
\item Save Thy servants, who hope in Thee, O my God.
\item Send them help, O Lord, from the holy place.
\item And from Sion protect them.
\item O Lord, hear my prayer.
\item And let my cry come unto Thee.
