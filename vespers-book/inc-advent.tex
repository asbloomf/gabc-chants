	Should doom to death a universe,

	\item Towards the Cross Thou wentest forth,
	That Thou might'st heal the crimes of earth;
	Proceeding from a virgin shrine,
	The spotless Victim all divine.

	\item At whose dread Name, majestic now,
	All knees must bend, all hearts must bow;
	And things celestial Thee shall own,
	And things terrestrial, Lord alone.

	\item O Thou, whose coming is with dread,
	To judge and doom the quick and dead.
	Thy heavenly grace on us bestow,
	To shield us from our ghostly foe.

	\item To God the Father, God the Son,
	And God the Spirit, Three in One,
	Laud, honour, might, and glory be
	From age to age eternally.

Uttered long ago

Peace confirm below.

\item Break the captive's fetters,

Passing meek and lowly,

Blameless chaste and holy.

Help our weak endeavour
Till we gaze on Jesus
