\item Thou heavenly, new Jerusalem,
Vision of peace in prophet's dream!
With living stones built up on high,
And rising to yon starry sky;
In bridal pomp thy form is crowned,
With thousand thousand angels round!

\item O bride, betrothed in happy hour,
The Father's glory is thy dower;
The bridegroom's grace is shed on thee
Thou queen all fair eternally;
To Christ allied, thy Prince adored,
Bright shining city of the Lord!

\item Behold with pearls they glittering stand
thy peaceful gates to all expand;
By grace and strength divinely shed
Each mortal thither may be led;
Who, kindled by Christ's love, will dare
All earthly sufferings now to bear.

\item By many a salutary stroke,
By many a weary blow that broke,
Or polished with a workman's skill,
The stones that form that glorious pile,
They all are fitly framed to lie
In their appointed place on high.

\item Fair and well pleasing in thy sight,
Parent most high, enthroned in light,
And for thine only Son most meet,
And thee, all-glorious Paraclete,
To whom praise, power, and glory rise
Forever through the eternal skies.
Amen.%\grechangestaffsize{15}
