{\item Sing, my tongue, the Saviour's glory
Of His Flesh the mystery sing;
Of His Blood all price exceeding,
Shed by our immortal King,
Destined for the world's redemption
From a noble womb to spring.
\item Of a pure and spotless Virgin,
Born for us on earth below,
He, as Man with man conversing,
Stayed the seeds of truth to sow.
Then He closed in solemn order
Wondrously His life of woe.
\item On the night of that last supper,
Seated with His chosen band,
He, the paschal victim eating,
First fulfils the Law's command;
Then as food to all His brethren
Gives Himself with His own Hand.
\item Word made Flesh the bread of nature
By His word to Flesh He turns;
Wine into His Blood He changes:
What though sense no change discerns,
Only be the heart in earnest,
Faith her lesson quickly learns.
\item Down in adoration falling,
Lo, the sacred Host we hail,
Lo, o'er ancient forms departing
Newer rites of grace prevail:
Faith for all defects supplying,
Where the feeble senses fail.
\item To the everlasting Father
And the Son who reigns on high
With the Holy Ghost proceeding
Forth from each eternally,
Be salvation, honour, blessing,
Might and endless majesty.
Amen.}
