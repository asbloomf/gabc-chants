\item Let us sing the songs that are Neri's due,
Whom Virtue and Merit famously exalted
Over the shining stars in the sky,
Where he might pluck the pious joys of heaven.

\item Seeing his dwelling place
Ravaged by sudden and calamitous fire,
He disdains weeping,
Though a few of his tears might easily overcome the flames.

\item Foregoing his uncle's magnanimous offer of gold coins,
He wendeth his way to Rome
Whom, more than any other city,
He illustriously makes to shine again.

\item Down in the catacombs,
Filled with the bodies of the martyrs,
He spends whole wakeful nights,
Busily learning from the very dead,
The rule whereby to live.

\item Constant Glory be to the nourishing Trinity,
Sustainer of the Sky, Abyss and Earth themselves;
And Who grant us through Neri's prayers
The perpetual joys of heaven, our true and native home.
The perpetual joys of the sweet native land.
Amen.%\grechangestaffsize{15}
