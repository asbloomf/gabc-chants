\def\hymntranslation{\item O God, the lot, reward, and prize
that crowns thy Martyr's victories,
grant, while we sing this Martyr's praise,
we may renounce our sinful ways.

\item The world with specious cheats disguised
he soon discovered and despised,
and laboured for a nobler gain
than palling pleasures mixed with pain.

\item No force could make his mind relent,
no racks his resolution bent,
fearless of death, he sheds his blood
and wades to heaven through the flood.

\item O vocal blood, now pierce the skies
and deal with heaven to hear our cries;
that on his glorious triumph we
may find indulgence, Lord, with thee.

\item Immortal glory, endless fame
the glorious works of God proclaim,
and sing with the celestial host
the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
